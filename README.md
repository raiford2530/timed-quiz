# Timed Quiz

The purpose of this project was to build a site where you can take a timed quiz and store your highscores. When the user clicks start quiz the timer begins. For each question that the user gets wrong ten seconds are subtracted from the timer. Once the time reaches zero or the user finishes before the time runs out, the user is able to enter their initials to save their score. The user can then vist the highscore page to see all of the highscores that have been saved and can also clear the high scores. The technologies used to create this project were Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
